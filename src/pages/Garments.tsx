                A person spends around one-third of their life in bed, and making that third as comfortable as possible has a lot to do with their choice of bed sheet. Having a great mattress, or your ideal duvet and pillows can be negatively affected if the sheets you're covering them with are wrong.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Cotton, polyester, fiber, Egyptian cotton, linen, silk, modal, Tencel and various other types of materials are available in the market. Egyptian or Pima cotton are both a more luxurious type of cotton. Cotton is a very popular choice when it comes to bed sheets, and has been used for at least 7000 years.

                Cotton is a natural product and because of the way it is designed and manufactured into clothing, it has many advantages, such as its ability to control moisture, insulate, provide comfort and it is also hypoallergenic, weatherproof and is a durable fabric.
              </p>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Cotton is known for its cooling properties. Wear a cotton shirt on a warm day and your skin will still be able to breathe and keep cool. A cotton shirt will also take moisture away from the skin, making it ideal for T-shirts that need to withstand regular washing.
